#### Artificial Intelligence R&D Engineer, Quadrical AI, Gurgaon, India (May 2019 – October 2020)
Framework: Python (Tensorflow/Keras), Flask, Postgresql, MongoDB, Docker, Microsoft Azure
- Created a real-time yield forecasting AI model using real-world unstructured sensor data for a leading solar company of India, which performed better than our business competitor, decreasing grid penalties by 90%.
- Developed a novel multi-objective supervised learning-based architecture to predict customer propensity for a leading e-commerce company in India. This model achieved a precision of 94%, beating their in-house model. (Real-world structured customer and product data)
- Developed a price prediction AI model for India’s No. 1 OTA (Online Travel Agency) with an ensemble of 5 novel architectures. (Real-world unstructured time-series data)
- Worked on preparing a standardized schema and developing the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for a leading solar company.
- Worked on backend development and DevOps to deliver the above products.
- Conducted interviews to hire candidates for the required engineering roles.

#### Summer Research Intern at Computer Vision Lab, IIT Madras, Chennai, India (May 2018 - July 2018) 
Research Topic: Deep video captioning, Framework: Python (PyTorch)
Supervisor: Prof. Anurag Mittal, Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
- A novel LSTM and CNN based architecture is proposed for deep video captioning using a combination of cross attention, action recognition, and object detection techniques.
- Increased the BLEU score by 40%, as compared to our previous vanilla model.
- Multiple captions for a particular video can be generated, depicting all the crucial instances.

#### Summer Research Intern at IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, India (May 2017 - July 2017)
Research Topic: Representation learning on text, images and acoustic data, Framework: Python (Keras/TensorFlow)
Supervisor: Prof. R. Balasubramanian, Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
- A novel step-based correlation multi-modal CNN (CorrMCNN) model was proposed, which reconstructs one view of the data given the other while increasing the interaction between the representations at every intermediate step.
- Through extensive numerical experiments, it was found that the proposed model performs much better than the existing state-of-the-art techniques for joint common representation learning and transfer learning on images, text and acoustic data.

#### Summer Research Intern at SWAN Lab, IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India (May 2016 - July 2016)
Research Topic: Quadcopter state prediction and wireless activation of sensor nodes, Framework: Python on Raspberry Pi
Supervisor: Prof. Sudip Misra, Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
- An ANN classification model was used to predict different states of the quadcopter based on sensor data.
- A cost-effective mobile master-node architecture was developed with a burst power node activation, consuming more than 100 times fewer units of electricity in a week’s run as compared to the traditional architecture.
