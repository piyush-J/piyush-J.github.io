I am Piyush Jha, a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Logic under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/vijay-ganesh">Prof. Vijay Ganesh</a>. Drawing on my experience in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, my research focuses on advancing AI's logical reasoning capabilities.

I am currently focused on applying <b>Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF)</b> to solve drug discovery-related problems and tackle combinatorially hard mathematical challenges. This new paradigm leverages symbolic reasoning tools to provide fine-grained feedback to Large Language Models (LLMs), enhancing their logical reasoning capabilities and addressing the limitations of traditional fine-tuning methods. Additionally, I am engaged in a project aimed at hacking LLM-based virtual assistants (such as ChatGPT) to identify underlying security issues and explore whether RLSF can enhance their security.

#### Areas I have worked on prior to pursuing my Ph.D.:
- Natural Language Processing: Hindi-Sanskrit translation with limited linguistic resources
- Representation Learning: Cross-modal Deep Learning algorithm (CorrMCNN)
- Trustworthy ML: Testing and verification tools for Neural Networks
- AI ∩ Formal Methods: SMT tactic selection
- AI ∩ Software Engineering: Reducing runtime errors in Java programs
- AI ∩ Cybersecurity: LLM in an RL loop to fuzz web applications
- AI ∩ Environmental Science: Predicting seasonal groundwater levels on a nationwide scale
- AI ∩ Law: Legal issues around Deepfakes
