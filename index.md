#### Short Biography
I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Logic. My research focuses on incorporating AI and deductive reasoning to solve complex combinatorial problems and to provide formal guarantees about the behaviors of ML systems which have an excellent prospect for impact on Neurosymbolic AI. My previous research lies at the intersection of ML and natural language, SAT solvers, reliable software, sustainability, and law. Based on my diverse research experiences across different industries and research labs, I have a couple of publications to date in the field of AI at reputed peer-reviewed international journals and conferences (ACM Transactions, IEEE, Pattern Recognition, LSE).
