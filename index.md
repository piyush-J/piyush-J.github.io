I am Piyush Jha, a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Logic under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/vijay-ganesh">Prof. Vijay Ganesh</a>. Drawing on my experience in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, my research focuses on efficiently combining Machine Learning with symbolic reasoning tools.

Recently, I developed Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), which integrates small language models with symbolic reasoning, outperforming GPT-4 on complex tasks using **1000x smaller models**. I also created AlphaMapleSAT, a novel SAT solver utilizing symbolic feedback within MCTS, **reducing computation time by 27x vs SOTA** for hard combinatorial problems. Additionally, I designed an LLM jailbreak framework with a **+50% success rate (vs SOTA at 2%)** against highly safety-trained LLMs. My work spans diverse fields, including energy, e-commerce, law, cybersecurity, chemistry, and formal methods, delivering real-world AI innovations.

#### Areas I have worked on prior to pursuing my Ph.D.:
- Natural Language Processing: Hindi-Sanskrit translation with limited linguistic resources
- Representation Learning: Cross-modal Deep Learning algorithm (CorrMCNN)
- Trustworthy ML: Testing and verification tools for Neural Networks
- AI ∩ Formal Methods: SMT tactic selection
- AI ∩ Software Engineering: Reducing runtime errors in Java programs
- AI ∩ Cybersecurity: LLM in an RL loop to fuzz web applications
- AI ∩ Environmental Science: Predicting seasonal groundwater levels on a nationwide scale
- AI ∩ Law: Legal issues around Deepfakes
