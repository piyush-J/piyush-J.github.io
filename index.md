I am Piyush Jha, a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Logic under the guidance of <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/vijay-ganesh">Prof. Vijay Ganesh</a>. Drawing on my experience in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, my research focuses on advancing AI's logical reasoning capabilities.

I am currently working on solving complex combinatorial problems using RL with deductive feedback. I am also engaged in a compelling project that involves hacking into Large Language Models (such as ChatGPT) to identify underlying issues and determine if integrating reasoning abilities can enhance their security.

Join me on this journey to revolutionize AI, making it safer, more reliable, and accountable. Thank you for exploring my work!

#### Areas I have worked on prior to pursuing my Ph.D.:
- Natural Language Processing: Hindi-Sanskrit translation with limited linguistic resources
- Representation Learning: Cross-modal Deep Learning algorithm (CorrMCNN)
- Trustworthy ML: Testing and verification tools for Neural Networks
- AI ∩ Formal Methods: SMT tactic selection
- AI ∩ Software Engineering: Reducing runtime errors in Java programs
- AI ∩ Cybersecurity: LLM in an RL loop to fuzz web applications
- AI ∩ Environmental Science: Predicting seasonal groundwater levels on a nationwide scale
- AI ∩ Law: Legal issues around Deepfakes
